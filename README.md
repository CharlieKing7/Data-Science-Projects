# My Data Science Portfolio

This is the repository that contains my data science projects. The repository is still "work in progress" and with time I will add more Jupyter Notebooks.

List of Projects:

1. Time Series Forecasting with XGboost: The aim of this notebook is consolidating the knowledge acquired with my first Kaggle Competition. In this notebook I mainly use Pandas for data wrangling. I also use some sklearn functions to prepare the features for ML and perform a basic cross-validation using an Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor.

# My Data Science Portfolio

This is the repository that contains my data science projects. The repository is still "work in progress" and with time I will add more Jupyter Notebooks.

List of Projects:

1. __Time Series Forecasting with XGboost:__ The aim of this notebook is consolidating the knowledge acquired with my first Kaggle Competition. In this notebook I mainly use Pandas for data wrangling. I also use some sklearn functions to prepare the features for learning. I finally perform a basic cross-validation using an Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor. Use the following link to see the notebook rendered with the Jupyter Notebook Viewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CharlieKing7/data-science-projects/blob/master/1_time-series-forecasting-xgboost.ipynb
